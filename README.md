# Deployment Process

A step-by-step deployment process for  these PHP Laravel web application to a Linux server:

1. Prepare the Linux Server:
   - Set up a Linux server (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS) with the required specifications (e.g., CPU, RAM, storage).
   - Install the necessary software and dependencies on the server, including PHP, a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx), a database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), and Git.

2. Configure the Web Server:
   - Set up the web server to serve the Laravel application. Do this by creating a virtual host configuration that points to the application's public directory.
   - Configure the necessary permissions and file ownership for the web server to access the application files.

3. Clone the Repository:
   - On the server, navigate to the directory where you want to deploy your application.
   - Use Git to clone your Laravel application repository from a version control system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) to the server.
   - Or use use a file transfer mechanism like FileZilla to upload the code to the server -- Git clone is recommended

4. Install Dependencies:
   - Use Composer (Our PHP dependency manager) to install the required PHP dependencies for The Laravel application.
   - Run the following command within your application directory: `composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader`.

5. Set Environment Variables:
   - Set up the environment variables required for the Laravel application, such as The live database credentials, cache settings, and application keys.
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the necessary values.

6. Generate Application Key:
   - Generate a unique application key for your Laravel application by running the following command: `php artisan key:generate`.

7. Run Migrations and Seeders:
   - Set up the database by running Laravel migrations to create the required database tables: `php artisan migrate`.
   - If your application has seeders, you can run them to populate the database with sample data: `php artisan db:seed`.

8. Configure File Permissions:
   - Ensure that the necessary directories (e.g., `storage`, `bootstrap/cache`) have proper write permissions for the web server user.

9. Configure Caching:
   - Optimize your application by caching configuration and routes: `php artisan config:cache` and `php artisan route:cache`.
   - Clear any existing application caches: `php artisan cache:clear`.

10. Set Up SSL/TLS (optional):
    - If you want to secure the application with HTTPS which i personally recommend, obtain an SSL/TLS certificate and configure the web server to use it.

11. Test the Deployment:
    - Restart the web server to apply the changes.
    - Access The application in a web browser and ensure it is working as expected.
    - Check the server and application logs for any errors or warnings.

12. Ongoing Maintenance:
    - You can also regularly update your application dependencies, including Laravel and its packages, by running `composer update`.
    - Keep your server's operating system and software up to date with security patches and updates.
    - Monitor server resources, application logs, and error logs to identify and address any issues.

With these steps, i believe generally the application should be up and running
